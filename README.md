# EMINST-Classification
This project aims to implement a simple classification of characters using common classifiers. Basics of machine learning and machine vision are used.
## Files
1. ML-Models.ipynp: training and testing of models
2. char_recognition.ipynp: classifying characters from provided image.
3. CLS_MLP.zip: contains the MLP classifiers
4. hellloworld.jpg shows an example of the character recognition
## Installation
If tkinter is not installed by default, then get it for your environment. Anaconda is recommended, since it has it by default.  
Now type the following:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
