This project aims to implement a simple classification of characters using common classifiers. Basics of machine learning and machine vision are used.
## Files
1. ML-Models.ipynp: training and testing of models
2. char_recognition.ipynp: classifying characters from provided image.
3. src/models: contains classifiers
